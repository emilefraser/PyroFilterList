#+TITLE: Unbound blocklist generator

This is a small Python program that takes a bunch of hostlists and generates an
output that can be included in an unbound configuration to block those hosts.

* What it does

Several blocklists are merged together. Duplicates are removed. Subdomains of
blocked domains are removed (unbound can block all subdomains of a
domain).

Finally, domains that are in the whitelist(s) are removed from the blocklist.

* Usage

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
python3 hosts.py \
    -b hosts/hosts \
    -b hosts/alternates/gambling/hosts \
    -b hosts/alternates/social/hosts \
    -w my-whitelist \
    > unbound.blocklist.cfg
#+end_src

* Requirement

- Python 3

* Blocklists

Input files can contain entries in the style of =/etc/hosts=: an ip address
followed by a host name, or can be just hostnames separated by newlines.

Lines starting with a =#= are ignored, and so is the text following a =#= sign
on lines that do contain data.

#+begin_src
# this is a comment
0.0.0.0 nasty.ad.domain.com

# ip address is ignored and can be anything
2001:: insta.com

facebook.com # comments can be after the host
#+end_src
